# üõí Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## üìå About
This project aims to explore Walmart sales data to understand top-performing branches and products, sales trends of different products, and customer behavior. The goal is to analyze sales strategies and optimize them for better performance. The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

> "In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact." - *Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition*

## üéØ Purposes of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into Walmart's sales data to understand the various factors affecting sales across different branches.

## üìå Revenue & Profit Calculations

### **Key Formulas**

üí∞ **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
\[ COGS = unit\_price \times quantity \]

üí∞ **VAT Calculation**
\[ VAT = 5\% \times COGS \]

üí∞ **Total Revenue**
\[ total\_sales = VAT + COGS \]

üí∞ **Gross Profit**
\[ gross\_income = total\_sales - COGS \]

üí∞ **Gross Margin Percentage**
\[ Gross Margin \% = \frac{gross\ income}{total\ revenue} \times 100 \]

### **Example Calculation (First Row in Dataset)**

Given:
- **Unit Price** = 45.79
- **Quantity** = 7

üìå **Calculations**
- **COGS** = 45.79 √ó 7 = **320.53**
- **VAT** = 5% √ó 320.53 = **16.03**
- **Total Sales** = 16.03 + 320.53 = **336.56**
- **Gross Margin Percentage** = (16.03 / 336.56) √ó 100 ‚âà **4.76%**
